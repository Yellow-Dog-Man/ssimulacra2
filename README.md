# SSIMULACRA 2 - Structural SIMilarity Unveiling Local And Compression Related Artifacts

Perceptual metric developed by Jon Sneyers (Cloudinary) in July-October 2022, updated in April 2023.

## Usage
```
ssimulacra2 original.png distorted.png
```

Returns a score in range -inf..100, which correlates to subjective visual quality scores as follows:

- negative scores: extremely low quality, very strong distortion.
- 10 = very low quality.
  MOS score close to 1 ('bad') in a BT.500 ACR test. Very obvious and annoying artifacts.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 14` / `-q 12` or libjpeg-turbo 4:2:0 quality 14.
- 30 = low quality.
  MOS score around 2 ('poor') in a BT.500 ACR test. Obvious and annoying artifacts.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 9` / `-q 20` or libjpeg-turbo 4:2:0 quality 20.
- 50 = medium quality.
  MOS score around 3 ('fair') in a BT.500 ACR test. Slightly annoying artifacts.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 5` / `-q 45` or libjpeg-turbo 4:2:0 quality 35.
- 70 = high quality.
  MOS score around 4 ('good') in a BT.500 ACR test. Artifacts are perceptible, but not annoying.
  Distortion barely noticeable by an average observer in a side-by-side comparison at 1:1 from a normal viewing distance.
  Without reference to the original image, an average observer does not notice artifacts.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 2.5` / `-q 73` or libjpeg-turbo 4:2:0 quality 70.
- 80 = very high quality.
  Distortion not noticeable by an average observer in a side-by-side comparison at 1:1 from a normal viewing distance.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 1.5` / `-q 85` or libjpeg-turbo 4:2:2 quality 85.
- 85 = excellent quality. 
  Distortion not noticeable by an average observer in the condition of in-place comparison at 1:1 from a normal viewing distance.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 1` / `-q 90` or libjpeg-turbo 4:4:4 quality 90.
- 90 = visually lossless.
  Distortion not noticeable by an average observer in a flicker test at 1:1 from a normal viewing distance.
  This corresponds to the typical output of `cjxl -d 0.5` / `-q 95` or libjpeg-turbo 4:4:4 quality 95.
- 100 = mathematically lossless.

## How it works

SSIMULACRA 2 is based on the concept of the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM),
computed in a perceptually relevant color space, adding two other (asymmetric) error maps, and
aggregating using two different norms.

- XYB color space (rescaled to a 0..1 range and with B-Y)
- Three error maps:
  - SSIM map (with a corrected SSIM formula that avoids applying gamma correction twice)
  - 'blockiness/ringing' map (error means distorted has edges where original is smooth)
  - 'smoothing/blur' map (error means distorted is smooth where original has edges)
- Each of these error maps is computed at 6 scales (1:1 to 1:32) for each component (X,Y,B)
- Downscaling is done in linear color (i.e. the perceptually correct way)
- For each of these `6*3*3=54` maps, two norms are computed: 1-norm (mean) and 4-norm
- A weighted sum of these `54*2=108` norms leads to the final score
- Weights were tuned based on a large set of subjective scores (CID22, TID2013, Kadid10k, KonFiG-IQA),
  including images compressed with JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XL, WebP, AVIF, HEIC, and various artificial distortions.


Final results after tuning:

SSIMULACRA 2.1:

Dataset | KRCC | SRCC | PCC |
-- | -- | -- | --
CID22|     0.6903 | 0.8805 | 0.8583
TID2013|   0.6590 | 0.8445 | 0.8471
KADID-10k| 0.6175 | 0.8133 | 0.8030
KonFiG(F)| 0.7668 | 0.9194 | 0.9136

SSIMULACRA 2.0:

Dataset | KRCC | SRCC | PCC |
-- | -- | -- | --
CID22|      0.6934 | 0.8820 | 0.8601
TID2013|    0.6322 | 0.8194 | 0.8103
KADID-10k|  0.5870 | 0.7851 | 0.7018
KonFiG(F)|  0.7813 | 0.9280 | 0.8710



The weight tuning was done by running Nelder-Mead simplex search, optimizing to minimize MSE and to
maximize Kendall and Pearson correlation for training data consisting of the CID22 training data,
TID2013, KADID-10k and KonFiG (F boosting).

Changes compared to SSIMULACRA 2.0:

- weights retuned to correlate better with other datasets
- changed the range of the 3 components to ensure they are in 0..1 so the SSIM formula makes sense
- added a polynomial remapping of the error score to allow a better fit to datasets with higher distortions


Changes compared to the [original version (SSIMULACRA 1)](https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra):

- works in XYB color space instead of CIE Lab
- linear downscaling
- fixed SSIM formula
- uses 1-norm and 4-norm (instead of 1-norm and max-norm-after-downscaling)
- penalizes both smoothing and ringing artifacts (instead of only penalizing ringing but not smoothing)
- removed specific grid-like blockiness detection
- tuned using a much larger set of subjective opinions (and using absolute quality scores, not just relative comparison results)

## Building

Building instructions for Debian:
```
sudo apt install build-essential git libhwy-dev liblcms2-dev libjpeg62-turbo-dev libpng-dev cmake ninja-build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -G Ninja
ninja ssimulacra2
```

or simply execute `build_ssimulacra2`. Other distributions should be similar;
you may need to use `libjpeg-turbo8-dev` instead of `libjpeg62-turbo-dev`.
Version 2.13 of lcms2 is needed.

The source code of SSIMULACRA 2 is also part of the `tools` of [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/blob/main/tools/ssimulacra2.cc).

The bash script `build_ssimulacra2_from_libjxl_repo` can be used to fetch the code and compile only what is needed for SSIMULACRA 2.

## Our Fork

Yellow-Dog-Man's fork was created purely to expoose the CLI functionality as a Shared Library, that can be called from [our .NET project](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Ssimulacra2.NET).

## Shared Library

Edits have been made, to expose SSIMULACRA 2 as a shared library suitable for C# Interop.

The Build Pipeline edits to support this were made with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) and Claude Sonnet 4.0. This was mostly focused on CMakeLists.txt. We welcome any PRs to improve the pipeline as Cmake is not our strong point.
